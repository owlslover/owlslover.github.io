## HELLO EVERYONE! 
# Welcome to my wonderful topic of taking this crazy class. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
# The class is called Concept of Operations and Information Technology.

## At first i was excited about taking this class, I wanted to know how my Officer In Charge was making all of his excel sheets and charts. Now that i am in this class, it is really hard and challenging for me. I missed a couple of classes due to prior agreements bugt the teacher was gracious enough to assist me a little more. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
I wouldnt take this experience away for anything because i have more knowlegde about computers and their programs.
